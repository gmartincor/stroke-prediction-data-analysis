# Stroke Prediction Data Analysis

This repository contains a data science project focused on analyzing and exploring a dataset related to stroke prediction. The main objectives are to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and apply basic programming and data science techniques using Python and pandas.

## Project Structure

- `PEC4_gmartincor_prog_datasci_4_entrega_ES (1).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all the analysis, code, and explanations.
- `data/stroke_df.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis, containing information about patients and stroke occurrence.

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`stroke_df.csv`) includes the following columns:
- `id`: Patient identifier
- `gender`: Gender of the patient
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `hypertension`: Whether the patient has hypertension (1: Yes, 0: No)
- `heart_disease`: Whether the patient has heart disease (1: Yes, 0: No)
- `ever_married`: Marital status
- `work_type`: Type of employment
- `Residence_type`: Urban or Rural residence
- `avg_glucose_level`: Average glucose level
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `smoking_status`: Smoking status
- `stroke`: Whether the patient had a stroke (1: Yes, 0: No)

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (VS Code, Jupyter Lab, etc.).
2. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
3. The notebook includes code for data loading, cleaning, exploration, and basic analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```
